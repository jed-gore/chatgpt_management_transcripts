Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $3.03 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $7.4 billion or $17.91 per share.
Included in the results for the fourth quarter were two adjusting items, which collectively benefited pre-tax earnings by $105 million. Net of these adjustments, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.82 and full year earnings per share or $17.71. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 2%, driven by growth in our domestic card business. This loan growth, coupled with net interest margin expansion, drove revenue up 3% on a linke√üd-quarter basis.
Noninterest expense grew 3% in the linked quarter, driven by an increase in marketing expenses while operating expenses were largely flat. Net of the adjustments I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were up 2.4%. Provision in the quarter -- provision expense in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.4 billion and an allowance build of about $1 billion. Turning to Slide 4.
I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1 billion increase in allowance in the fourth quarter brings our total company year-end allowance balance up to $13.2 billion, increasing the total company coverage ratio by 22 basis points to 4.24%. I'll cover the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our domestic card business, the allowance balance increased by $795 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.97%.
Three things put upward pressure on our card allowance. The first factor was the continued credit normalization in our portfolio. The second factor was a modestly worse economic outlook than our assumption a quarter ago. And finally, we built allowance for the loan growth in the quarter.
The impact of the fourth quarter loan growth on the allowance is more muted than typical loan growth given the seasonal nature of these balances. These three factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $129 million, driving a 20 basis point increase in coverage to 2.8%. The build was primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto business, including lower recovery rates.
The second factor also putting upward pressure on our allowance is the impact of a modestly worse economic outlook. These two factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. And finally, in our commercial business, the allowance increased $73 million, resulting in a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 1.54%. This was largely driven by reserve builds for our office portfolio.
Turning to Page 6. I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 143%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves increased by $14 billion to $107 billion.
Strong consumer deposit growth throughout the quarter drove cash balances higher and allowed us to pay down prior FHLB borrowings. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our net interest margin was 6.84% in the fourth quarter, 24 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 4 basis points higher than the prior quarter.
The 4 basis point linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by higher asset yields and a balance sheet mix shift toward card loans. This impact was mostly offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the fourth quarter, up about 30 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.2 billion of net income in the quarter was partially offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $150 million of common stock in the quarter, bringing the repurchases for the full year to $4.8 billion. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?

Thank you, Andrew, and welcome, everybody. I'll begin on Slide 10 with fourth quarter results in our credit card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.
In the fourth quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our domestic card business. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Ending loan balances increased $22.9 billion or about 21% year over year. Ending loans grew 8% from the sequential quarter.
And revenue was up 19% year over year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans, as well as strong revenue margin. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize and were below pre-pandemic levels. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.2%, up 173 basis points year over year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.43%, 121 basis points above the prior year.
On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 102 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 46 basis points. Noninterest expense was up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2021, which includes an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our choice in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing.
In our domestic card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to see the effects of our choice to pull back on auto growth in response to competitive pricing dynamics that have pressured industry margins. Auto originations declined 32% year over year and 20% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking loan growth continued to be slower than previous quarters. Fourth quarter ending loans grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter.
On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. Fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 6% year over year, and up 5% over the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 4% year over year and up 3% from the sequential quarter. Our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction.
Consumer Banking revenue was up 10% year over year as growth in auto loans and deposits was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins. Noninterest expense was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and marketing for our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the fourth quarter. The charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 1.66%, up 108 basis points year over year.
The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.62%, up 130 basis points year over year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 61 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 77 basis points. Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, fourth quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were flat.
Ending deposits were down 1% from the linked quarter. Average deposits grew 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was down 23% from the linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by an internal funds transfer pricing impact that was offset by an equivalent increase in the other category and was, therefore, neutral to the company.
Excluding this impact, fourth quarter commercial revenue would have been down about 6% quarter over quarter and up 2% year over year. Noninterest expense was up 2% from the linked quarter. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate increased 74 basis points from the linked quarter to 6.71% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.74%.
In closing, we continue to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the fourth quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we continued to pull back on auto originations. Consumer deposits grew. And in our Commercial Banking business, ending loans and deposits were roughly flat compared to the linked quarter.
Charge-off rates and delinquency rates continue to normalize across our business and were below pre-pandemic levels. Total company operating expense net of adjustments was up 2.4% from the linked quarter. Our annual operating efficiency ratio for full year 2022 was 44.5% net of adjustments, a 15 basis points improvement from full year 2021. And we expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022.
Pulling way up, we continue to see opportunities for resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we're continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. We're focusing on efficiency improvement and we're managing capital prudently.
As a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, we're in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?
Yes. Let me just start with a reminder of what we mean by Growth Math. As a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and then gradually come down. When we accelerate growth and especially when those new loans are added to a seasoned back book with low losses, it can increase the overall level of losses of the portfolio.

We grew rapidly. For example, just looking back at when we talk a lot about Growth Math, we grew rapidly in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and add a particularly visible growth math effect in the wake of that growth. At that time, the large front book was adding to a back book that was unusually seasoned, because it had survived the -- great Recession. Given our recent rate of growth, I think it's likely we'll see some Growth Math effect again over the next few years.

But I think the general normalization trend will be the bigger driver of our credit trajectory. One other thing that's different about Growth Math going forward is CECL. Under the CECL accounting regime, the allowance impact of new growth are pulled forward significantly. We haven't seen this effect for most of the pandemic even as we have accelerated our growth because of the offsetting favorable factors in our allowance.

But as our growth continues, a portion of our allowance builds going forward are intended to support that growth.
So here, as I said in the past, we are largely consumers of economic assumptions. In this particular case for unemployment, we are assuming something that's a little modestly higher than consensus estimates for where we will land in the fourth quarter. I think consensus is somewhere around 48%. We're -- our baseline forecast gets up to around 5% in the fourth quarter, but it's important to note there's a lot of other things that go into the calculation of the reserve things like unemployment -- sorry, changes in the unemployment rate, inflation, home prices, wages, all of those factors matter as well, but our unemployment assumption is to be around 4% in the fourth quarter -- sorry, around 5% in the fourth quarter.
OK. Thanks, Ryan. So consumer credit metrics remain strong. And of course, as we've seen, they've been normalizing steadily through 2022 and are approaching prepandemic levels.

The -- At first normalization was more pronounced in some segments more than others. It was -- of course -- and by the way, this is always the case that front book, new originations tend to be higher. So that would have been shocking had it been different. But the other thing we also said and talked to investors about it was more -- normalization was happening everywhere, but it was more pronounced at the lower end of the market.

More recently, we've actually seen more uniform trend of normalization across businesses and segments. So for example, across various FICO score ranges and also across income levels. When we index them on credit metrics back to where they were before the pandemic, the sort of rest of the credit spectrum and rest of the income spectrum caught up to the -- very recently in the last few months to the lower end. So really, if I pull on that, it looks like the normalization is pretty consistent across the board.
So you asked various competitors are forecasting or talking about different times at which things cross 2019 levels. I think at Capital One, we're not making specific predictions is on that. But I think the key thing I would have you look at is the delinquency metrics. Delinquency metrics are the best single predictor of where things are going to go in the near term.

And in fact, if we look at flow rates, we can see that very early flow rates into delinquency buckets are pretty normalized. So we're not giving specific guidance. But we would say, look at the credit metrics, look at the dynamics across other metrics, but we feel this is -- it's clearly normalizing as we see it.
Yes. Ryan, our efficiency outlook is exactly the same as it was last quarter. If you recall, actually, we guided to the -- for full year 2022 for efficiency to be flat -- basically kind of flat to 2021, and then modestly down for 2023 relative to 2021. What happened is that '22 came in a little bit lower.

So our guidance of flat to modestly down, it's the same outlook as we had before. And so, they know there's not big investments behind that. It's a continued journey of Capital One to lean into our opportunities to continue to invest in the tech opportunities that we see and the opportunities to create breakthroughs in the marketplace and continue to transform how we work. But pulling way up the sort of story if you kind of pull way back on operating efficiency, the journey that where we've driven 440 basis points of improvement from 2013 well through 2019.

And then, we had the whole pandemic thing. But if I pull way up the gradual operating efficiency improvement is what we are continuing to drive for through the leveraging of our tech transformation even as we continue to invest.
Yes, Betsy, I'll start with your last question first, which is we are following the forward curve, assuming 50 bps here in the first quarter and holding flat throughout '23 before coming down in '24. With respect to how we're thinking about beta and asset yields as components of NIM as we get into the latter part of this rate cycle, lagged deposit rates really have a bigger impact than the asset yields that reprice more quickly and did so over the last couple of quarters as the Fed was moving rapidly. And so, there's a bit of that sequential dynamic going on in terms of thinking about overall deposit beta and product mix roughly 85% of our deposits are in consumer. It's where our focus lies.

And so, if you just look at the cumulative deposit beta for the total company, it's around 35%, was low 20s last quarter. But if you look at the last increasing rate cycle, I think the terminal beta was around 41%. So I could see a terminal beta being somewhere above that, just given competitive dynamics in the marketplace at this point. So I would say the net of all of those factors is likely to be a modest headwind to NIM.

We talked last quarter about balance sheet mix. And we are largely back to a pre-pandemic balance sheet mix from where we were a year ago. And frankly, our NIM is roughly in a similar spot. So I would say balance sheet mix over a multiple quarter period isn't likely to be a big driver unless we just see outsized growth in the higher-margin card business.

And then, the other factor that could prove to be a tailwind to potentially offset a little bit of the modest headwind that probably comes from the beta dynamics that I described is we could also see a bit of an increase in card revolve rates from where they are today. So all of those things are just to leave you with kind of a net impression that there are headwinds and potentially some tailwinds. But the one thing I will just note as we look ahead to the first quarter, as a reminder, in the way we calculate NIM day count has an effect. So the one thing we know for sure is we'll have a 14 basis point or so headwind in Q1 due to having two fewer days in the quarter.
